# What is kubernetes (K8)
- it is an open source system fir automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. 

# Benefits of k8
- has multi cloud capabilities 
- automation of deployment and scalability 
- open source
- better stability 
- high avaliability 

# Kubernetes architecture 
## objects
- objects are persistant entities they use these entities to represent the state of your cluster 

# Difference bettwen signle and multi node clusters
## single node cluster 
- a single node cluster can be useful for development and testing environments, or for small scale deployments 
## multi node clusters 
- This is more suitable for production workloads that require high avlability and scalability. 
- This architecture provides better performance, reliability, and scalability by 
distributing the workload across multiple nodes.


# how to get k8 running with docker(desktop)
- go to settings and tick the enable kubernetes box
